		On Fey
	</h3>
	<p>Before you read further, consider the nature of your setting, how you want magic&mdash;especially interplanar magic&mdash;to function, and how much bleed there is between fey realms and the mortal realm&mdash;this material is intended to be used as readily in a modern fantasy as it is a traditional high-fantasy setting. Either way, consider the two following aspects when developing your setting. These ideas are not mutually exclusive: indeed, one might lead directly into the other.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Once in a Lifetime:</strong> The border between realms is not frequently crossed, and one (or two) crossings might be enough to drive the entire story. You (and the players) might need to keep an eye on the calendar, the location of the nearest usable portal, and avoiding any unwanted attention in worlds other than your own. An intimate tale about the clash of two worlds is about to unfold.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Two Worlds:</strong> The story revolves around two intimately connected realities. Significant events in one might affect the other, although most people remain blissfully unaware of this fact. For the PCs, crossing between the two might become a frequent occurrance.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent"><strong>Extraplanar Kaleidoscope:</strong> You desire to open the door from a mundane world into an extraplanar wonderment. You are unafraid to tell high-weird stories that use <a href="index.html#choose-optional-rules">Optional Rules</a> or strange effects, such as time dilation. Fey in these setting exist as a matter of course, and some might have regular contact or have set up enclaves upon the other worlds.</p>

	<p>Most boggles resemble monstrous, gnarled gnomes with at least one prominent wart on their face, but they can display a staggering variety: some boggles are hirsute, some are completely bald. Some boggles have monstrous features&mdash;wild pigmentation, horns, teeth, or claws&mdash;which make them look quite fearsome&mdash;at least to a child. Naturally jealous creatures, boggles that lack these ornamentations adopt a monstrous persona through trickery, and even those that do have them are not above a little enhancement to their appearance.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">Petty mischief delights and even nourishes boggles, who frighten and bedevil folk&mdash;such pranks are always annoying, but usually harmless. The most unseelie of boggles frighten mortal children, hiding under their beds or in their closets, feeding on their victims' fear. As with all boggle mischief, their behavior is usually an expression of deep self-loathing. A defeated boggle might offer its services in recompense if cornered, although precious few are strong-willed enough to truly get the best out of a boggle's mischievous compulsions in the long-term.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">You gain the following characteristics:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> Your small size makes some physical tasks difficult. Might-based tasks are hindered.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> Your Intellect defense tasks are hindered.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Inability:</strong> Your distinctive scent eases tasks to locate you by smell within a short distance. Roll on the boggle scents table, or create your own scent.

	<p>Most gwaloth have the appearance of wiry dwarves made of wood, although adults can stand up to 12 feet (4 m) tall. They travel unshod, with a thick coating of raw earth around their root-like feet. Most live in areas dense with other plant life&mdash;sun-dappled forests, whispering pines, buzzing jungles, and teeming swamps. A precious few live in mountainous scrublands, and fewer still in deserts&mdash;hermits in places with limited sunlight, water, and fertile soil.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">Most gwaloth are unbridled optimists who advocate for peaceful coexistence with others, a virtue they inherit from native gardens. Only those who take a vow a strict pacifism are considered for the rites of adulthood. Gwaloth leaders literally <em>put their roots down</em>&mdash;never leaving their planting positions as a sign of their dedication to the garden.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">You gain the following characteristics:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled og-csrd-indent">

		<li><p><strong>Long-Lived:</strong> Your natural lifespan (unless tragically cut short) is thousands of years.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Photosynthetic:</strong> You gain nutrients from sunlight and fertile soil. You don't need to eat or breathe if you have daily exposure to sufficient sunlight. Enabler.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Summerbloom:</strong> You gain the <a href="#ability-summerbloom">Summerbloom</a> ability, and you can pay its point cost with your Might Pool instead. Enabler.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Timberskin:</strong> Your skin produces a pattern of exterior enchanted wood-like bark that grants you +1 to Armor if you do not wear physical armor&mdash;this armor also shields your mind against mental attacks that would inflict damage to your Intellect Pool (even if you are wearing physical armor). Your timberskin provides no protection from fire, however, and your stiff limbs are ill suited for agility&mdash;you have an inability in running, jumping, swimming, and Speed defense tasks. Enabler.</p></li>
		<li><p class="og-csrd-indent"><p><strong>Put Down Roots:</strong> When you make a defense roll and you are standing on fertile ground, you can plunge your roots into it. Until the end of your next turn, you cannot move, but gain an asset on all defense rolls you make. At that time, you can make a free <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>. Enabler.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Give Fruit:</strong> When you make a <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery roll</a>, you can divide points into a fruiting instead of your stat Pools. The fruiting sprouts from your body in the manner of your choosing. A creature&mdash;other than you&mdash;that uses an action to eat a fruiting can divide its points among their stat Pools however they wish. Any fruiting you produce spoils at the end of your next ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler.</li>

		<p>Most any clothing gwaloth appear to wear&mdash;and indeed their very faces&mdash;are grown at their own direction, and mostly as courtesy to others. Gwaloth who are accustomed to their own kind might display a single enormous flower for a head, with dewy beads of fruit arranged in a delicate pattern.</p>
		<p class="og-csrd-indent">With a year of dedicated effort, a gwaloth can completely alter their appearance to suit their environment or lifestyle.

	<p>Ikwiikwii resemble bipedal owls with no wings and short, talon-fingered hands. They are short, stocky and display powerful musculature for their diminutive frame. Most live in mountains and boreal forests, and are capable hunters. Rarely farmers, ikwiikwii consider it a point of pride to hunt for their own dinner, even encouraging their small children to fend for themselves.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">Mated ikwiikwii do so for life. Family groups rarely exceed four individuals at a time. If a family grows too large, the eldest child is encouraged to leave the nest. Leaving the nest marks adulthood in their lives, and parents make a great display, showering gifts and well-wishes upon their departing child, or throw a party attended by friends and extended family.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">You gain the following characteristics:</p>

		<p>"Unexpected" is a key word when ruling on interactions with an ikwiikwii's Night Vision. Untimely reflections of sunlight might be a good source of occasional GM intrusion for an ikwiikwii PC. As a baseline, looking directly at the sun at midday is a difficulty 6 Might defense roll. Item, effect or creature level might make sense to use, but consider a light's brightness in relation to the ambient light in the environment. Waving a mundane torch in an ikwiikwii's face at noon might be unexpected, but probably doesn't overwhelm the ambient light to require a defense roll.</p>

	<p>Pixies vary in appearance, and it can change dramatically as they age. While most folk picture a miniature elf with the wings of an insect, pixies can share features with most any kind of animal, plant, monster, dragon, or other creature one could imagine. At auspicious moments, murmurations of pixies gather in these areas in a function known as an <em>eisteddfod</em> where they dance, play games, tell tales, wrestle, and copulate with one another in dazzling displays of light and flight.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">Prestige is everything to a pixie: their short seasons and long years are an endless game of acquisitions and losses played among their troop. They are taught to defend pride and territory with ferocity, know when a tactical retreat will serve them best, and to exact just vengeance upon those who have done them wrong. Throughout this education, a strong sense of fair play is stressed, but cunning and creativity are considered virtues.</p>
	<p class="og-csrd-indent">Just as mortals caution their children against wee folk, so wee folk caution their children about mortals&mdash;"they seem amusing playthings, but are dangerous." Yet still, adventurous young pixies visiting the mortal world to attempt something that will make a worthy tale at the next <em>eisteddfod</em>, and a few of them find kindred spirits in dreamers, idealists, musicians, poets, and hopeless romantics, and an intense, long-lasting&mdash;even dangerous&mdash;bond between the two might form. A mortal bonded to a pixie companion might be spurred to new heights of heroism and mischief&mldr;or they die, as all things must do one day. Then again&mdash;as the pixie elders say&mdash;<em>a life lived in fear is a life half-lived</em>.</p>

		<li><p><strong>Tiny Size:</strong> You are small enough to fit places many cannot, and hide behind common objects. Your tiny size is an asset on hiding and escaping tasks. Enabler.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Pixie Wings (2 Intellect points):</strong> You can fly up to a short distance each round for up to 1 hour. While flying, you emit a flickering, dim light and emit a soft noise, which hinders all stealth tasks and eliminates your asset to stealth tasks from Tiny Size. Enabler.</p></li>

When their story is concluded, the PC might return these objects to their planar patron, or ensure they are returned to an appropriate location or person.

			<p>Long after their remains have turned to dust, the spirit of an individual can linger still. There are as many reasons for a ghost to haunt the world as there are folk in it. Most ghosts awaken disoriented and must discover what it is that holds their attachment to the world of the living, as if discovering a final piece of themselves that they must confront before entering the next phase of their existence.</p>
			<p class="og-csrd-indent">Ghosts retain their general appearance as it was in life, although those who knew them often have difficulty recognizing them (much to the ghost's frustration). They also retain all of their memories&mdash;and these, perhaps all too well. As the years go by with their business unconcluded, ghosts have difficulty forming new memories, or relating to a world that drifts further from their own time. These ghosts become haunts and specters, appearing only when the world of the living presents a mirror for them to find something familiar in.</p>

		<li id="ability-amaneusis">
			<p><strong>Amaneusis (2 Intellect points):</strong> You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied onto parchment (or into some other appropriate object) you provide. This spell copies approximately 250 words per minute for up to an hour, creating a perfect transcription of the original. The spell only copies mundane text, ignoring illustrations, diagrams or supernatural inscriptions, leaving empty spaces where excluded items appeared in the original. Alternatively, you can also use this spell to dictate verbally, and have your dictation transcribed as if written in your own hand.</p>
			<p class="og-csrd-indent">The spell automatically turns to the next blank page and continues its transcription until it completes the transcription, or it runs out of available pages. Action to initiate.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-animate-flying-servantor">
			<p><strong>Animate Flying Servantor:</strong> You give life an object, which becomes a level 3 follower of your size or smaller. It accompanies you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the details of your servantor. You'll probably make rolls for it when it takes actions. A robot assistant in combat usually doesn't make separate attacks but helps with yours. On your action, if the servantor is next to you, it serves as an asset for one attack you make on your turn. If the servantor is destroyed, you can repair the original with a few days' worth of tinkering, or build a new one with a week's worth of half-time labor. The servantor can fly a long distance each round. It can carry you, but only for up to an hour between each of your ten-hour <a href="index.html#recovery-rolls">recovery rolls</a>. Enabler.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="ability-apparition">

			<p><strong>Conjure Familiar (1+ Intellect points):</strong> A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your instructions. This creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg). You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you'll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The familiar acts on your turn. As a level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and 3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your familiar is reduced to 0 health, it becomes banished until you conjure it again. Action to initiate, 10 minutes to complete.</p>
		</li>

If can apply a level of Effort using this ability, you can also bring one willing creature within your reach.</p>
			<p class="og-csrd-indent">If you arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you (and any creature teleporting with you) each take 4d6 force damage, and are ejected prone where you used this ability. Action.</p>
